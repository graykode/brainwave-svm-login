brainwave-svm-login
===================

# 1. simple login system using brainwave
We can login system with individual brainwave. Each person have 10 brainwave datas, using support vector machine this problem to solve.
But. This few data make overfit.. so predict test by cross-validation show low accuracy

# 2. svmlib
[svm-lib](https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm)

# 3. Modeling
When modeling, using scaling show low accuracy. It does not matter use scaling.
